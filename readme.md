## About
Grassroots is a political discussion app for creating message boards bounded by your congressional district. This mechanic encourages discourse with the people you live near and hopefully, a better understanding of your neighbors.

See [Grassroots - service](https://github.com/dpim/grassroots-service) for the backend implementation
